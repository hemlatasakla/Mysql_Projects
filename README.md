🍕 **Pizzahut Sales Analysis using MySQL**

Hello! 👋 I'm Hemlata Sakla, and this project is all about diving into pizza sales data using SQL — because what's better than combining data analysis and pizza? 😄

Through this project, I explored how simple queries can reveal meaningful business insights, which can help companies improve decision-making and boost sales.

🔍**What This Project is All About**

The project revolves around analyzing sales data from a pizza business to understand key aspects of its operations and customer preferences. Using SQL, I answered business-focused questions like:

✔️ How much revenue has the business generated?

✔️ Which pizza types are most popular among customers?

✔️ Which pizza sizes sell the most?

✔️ When are peak ordering hours?

✔️ How has the revenue evolved over time?

Beyond just queries, this project allowed me to think like a data analyst — breaking down requirements, translating them into technical SQL tasks, and interpreting the results in a way that helps a business grow.

🗄️ **Project Dataset Overview**

The analysis was based on a structured dataset containing four interconnected tables:

**Table Name	Description**

Orders	Contains order details including order IDs and timestamps.

Order_Details	Breaks down individual pizza orders with quantities.

Pizzas	Provides details of each pizza such as price and size.

Pizza_Types	Contains pizza categories and specific pizza names.

Working with this relational structure helped me strengthen my understanding of how tables connect using keys, and how to efficiently query them for meaningful results.

📊 **Key Business Insights Unlocked**

Here are some of the powerful insights I extracted through SQL queries:

🔹 Total number of orders placed 🧾

🔹 Total revenue generated from pizza sales 💰

🔹 Identification of the highest-priced pizza 🍕

🔹 Most commonly ordered pizza size 📏

🔹 Top 5 most ordered pizza types by quantity 🏆

🔹 Quantity of pizzas sold per category 📦

🔹 Order distribution by hour of the day ⏰

🔹 Top-performing pizzas by revenue in each category 💡

🔹 Cumulative revenue trend over time 📈

These insights reflect the real-world challenges businesses face, and how simple, structured data analysis can help answer them.

🛠️ **Skills & Tools Used**

🗄️ MySQL — Database Management & Query Execution

I used MySQL, one of the most popular relational database management systems, as the backbone for this project. It helped me:

✅ Create, manage, and interact with structured datasets effectively.

✅ Write and execute SQL queries to extract business insights from multiple connected tables.

✅ Practice handling real-world data stored across different tables with proper relationships.

💡 **What I Gained from This Project**

✨ Strengthened my SQL skills and ability to work with relational databases.

✨ Gained confidence in writing complex queries with multiple joins and conditions.

✨ Learned how raw data can be converted into clear, business-ready insights.

✨ Improved my approach to problem-solving through structured thinking.

✨ Discovered the impact even simple data analysis can have on real-world operations.

✨ Sparked my interest to go deeper into data analytics, SQL optimization, and visualization tools.
